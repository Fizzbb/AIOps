# Gartner AIOps 11 categories
* Historic data management – A big data management solution for storing and accessing historical data from the many different data sources that feed an AIOps environment.
* Streaming data management – Software that allows for real-time capture (as opposed to historical capture) and presentation of the data sources feeding the environment.
* Log data ingestion – Software that captures alphanumeric text strings from applications and hardware devices, and prepares that data for analysis, access, and indexing for storage.
* Wire data ingestion – Software that captures packet data from network taps for analysis, access, and indexing for storage.
* Metric data ingestion – Software for the capture, analysis, and access to time series and general mathematical operations performed on I&O data.
* Document text ingestion – Software for the capture, parsing, and syntactical and semantic indexing of human readable documents, including natural language processing (NLP).
* Automated pattern discovery and prediction – Software that uses historical and streaming data to detect patterns describing correlations that can be inferred from the captured datasets. Discovered patterns are predictive, foretelling future events with different degrees of probability.
* Anomaly detection – Software that uses discovered patterns to determine baseline system behavior and detect departures from that normal behavior.
* Root cause determination – Software that cuts through the pattern discovery and prediction components of an AIOps platform and finds the most genuine cause and effect relationships that may need attention.
* On-premises delivery – The ability to deliver any of the other AIOps software elements as an internal on-premises solution.
* Software as a service – The ability to deliver AIOPs software elements as a cloud offering.
